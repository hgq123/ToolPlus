## Edit Operators

### Bezier Intersection
Select exactly two segments to split them at their intersections.

### Bezier Merge Ends
Merges two end control points into one while preserving the relative positions of their handles.

This operator enables you to select multiple segments and split them at custom parameters simultaneously.

### Bezier Offset

### Bezier Circle
Add a bezier circle which completes the selected segment into a full circle.

### Bezier Length
