Tubes and Pipes
Blender addon
by Roman Sychev

A set of menu options for fast creation of customizable Tube and Pipe objects.
The Tube is designed as a quickly created primitive.
The Pipe is a more customizable object.

Functions:

Tube - creates a simple Tube object. Customizable inner and outer radius, height and mesh resolution. Options to create as either a mesh or an extruded curve. Polygons are automatically optimized with the "create as mesh" option to simplify further mesh editing.

Pipe - creates 2 objects, a Pipe cross-section and a path (represented as the Pipe itself), both as customizable curves. Properties similar to those of the Tube can be set on creation. After initial creation the pipe shape can be customized by editing either of these objects in the Edit Mode.

Convert to Mesh - while a Pipe or a Tube created as a curve is selected, convert it to mesh, with an option to smooth the rim edges. All polygons are optimized.
