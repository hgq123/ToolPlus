 * The T+ Addons Sets in this folders are tool collections and includes free scripts from allover.

 * Means: one part of is scripted by me and the other part is taken from different authors who give them away for free.

 * Take a look into a script if you want more information about single authors, functions, wiki links or more about the included GNU General Public Licenses.
 
 * I created the t+ addons in my private time and for my personal workflow, because it makes fun and save time at the end.
